I am very proud to share our last project (postgraduate database system).
We used node.js, express.js, and MS SQL Server. 
We built this project from scratch, we started by designing the relational database, implementing the required tables and procedures, and then building the website (backend and frontend).

The project is available on GitHub you can check the code, your feedback will be very appreciated.
